<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is a film that made me think of how much creative someone can be. I love the way Christopher Nolan has combined both creativity and Science together.</p>
<h3>Battleship</h3>
<p>A good movie featuring actions in the sea by navy to defend the world against aliens.</p>
<h3>Fury</h3>
<p>A good action movie showing us the life and hardships of a tank crew throughout the World War | |.</p>
